# Rank Bounds: sr, AttainedScottRank, and rank-height relations

This file defines `sr` (the supremum of element ranks without the +1 adjustment)
and `AttainedScottRank`, and proves bounds relating `sr`, `scottRank`, and
`scottHeight`.

## Main Definitions

- `sr`: Supremum of element ranks (without +1), as opposed to `scottRank` (with +1).
- `AttainedScottRank`: Whether the supremum in `sr` is attained by some element.

## Main Results

- `sr_le_scottRank`: sr ≤ scottRank always.
- `sr_le_scottHeight_of`: sr ≤ scottHeight (conditional on CRH), and the unconditional
  `sr_le_scottHeight` (through `countableRefinementHypothesis`).
- `scottRank_le_scottHeight_succ_of`: scottRank ≤ scottHeight + 1 (conditional on CRH), and the
  unconditional `scottRank_le_scottHeight_succ`.
- `stabilizationOrdinal_le_scottHeight`: whole-model recognition happens no later than complete
  stabilization.

/-- The supremum of element ranks without the +1 adjustment.

Compare with `scottRank`, which is `⨆ m, elementRank m + 1`.  Like `elementRank`, this `sr` is
element-based and cross-structure: each `elementRank m` compares the singleton `![m]` with
tuples of other countable structures.  It is not an internal (orbit) rank defined from the
automorphism orbits of `M` (for that, see `orbitRank` and `internalScottRank` in
`Scott/OrbitRank.lean`); on the infinite pure set `ℕ` every element has `elementRank = ω`
(`scripts/check_rank_convention_regressions.lean`), although every tuple has orbit rank `0`
(`orbitRank_pureSet`).
See the convention table in the module docstring of `Scott/Height/Defs.lean`. -/

/-- The element-rank supremum `sr` is bounded by `scottHeight`.

Since `scottHeight M` is a complete stabilization ordinal (conditional on
`CountableRefinementHypothesis`), every `elementRank m ≤ scottHeight M`, so
the supremum `sr M = ⨆ m, elementRank m ≤ scottHeight M`. -/

/-- `scottRank M ≤ scottHeight M + 1`.

Since `scottRank M = ⨆ m, elementRank m + 1` and each `elementRank m ≤ scottHeight M`
(via `elementRank_le_completeStab` at the complete stabilization ordinal `scottHeight M`),
we get `scottRank M ≤ scottHeight M + 1`. Conditional on

/-- A structure has attained Scott rank if some element achieves the supremum `sr`.

This is an important distinction in the theory of Scott rank: when the rank is
attained, the structure has a "witness" element of maximal complexity. -/

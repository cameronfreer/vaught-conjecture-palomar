# Graded matching families imply back-and-forth equivalence

Let `R α n a b` be a family of relations between `n`-tuples `a` of `M` and `b` of `N`, graded by
ordinals `α` up to a height bound `height`.  Suppose that `R` is atomic at level `0` (it implies
`SameAtomicType`), that it lowers, and that at successor levels it has the forth and back
extension properties one level down.  Then every pair related at a level `α ≤ height` is
`α`-back-and-forth equivalent: `R α n a b → BFEquiv α n a b`.  This is the only ordinal
induction of the module (`bfEquiv_of_gradedSystem`); every other theorem is derived from it.

This is ordinal-budget matching: the height is an arbitrary ordinal budget, not required to be
countable; countable budgets are the immediate application.

No new notion of back-and-forth equivalence is introduced: the conclusion is the existing
`BFEquiv` of `Scott/BackAndForth.lean`, unfolded through `BFEquiv.zero`, `BFEquiv.succ` and
`BFEquiv.limit`.  Bundled graded systems are intended to instantiate this theorem with
`height := α`.

## The seed is a separate premise

The laws (atomic, lowering, forth, back) are closure conditions, and the empty family
`R := fun _ _ _ _ ↦ False` satisfies all of them vacuously.  They therefore say nothing about any
particular pair: each theorem takes, besides the laws, a *seed* `R α n a b` at the pair and
level of interest, and concludes `BFEquiv` only there.

## Conventions

* **Ordinals.**  The ordinal universe `uι` is free, as in `BFEquiv`; `Ordinal.{0}` is one
  instance.  The core theorem states successors as `Order.succ α`, the form `BFEquiv.succ` uses;
  the one-law form `bfEquiv_of_gradedMatching` and the receipt forms state them as `α + 1`,
  which is `Order.succ α` by `Order.succ_eq_add_one`.
* **Height.**  Every law is required only at levels `≤ height`.  The core theorem has separate
  `down` and `limit` clauses, the shape of a bundled graded system.  They imply lowering on
  levels `≤ height`, but a consumer supplies them without its own ordinal induction, in
  particular with `height := α`.
* **Generality.**  The statements are proved without the `[L.IsRelational]` instance, because
  `BFEquiv`'s own lemmas omit it.  For languages with function symbols, `SameAtomicType` covers
  only equalities and relation atoms on coordinates, so the conclusion is this repository's
  `BFEquiv`, not `L∞ω`-equivalence.  The carrier universes `w` and `w'` are independent; there is
  no countability or nonemptiness assumption on `M`, `N` or `L`; tuples may be empty or have
  repeated coordinates; `R` need not be symmetric; and receipts need not be unique and may change
  under lowering.

## Main declarations

* `bfEquiv_of_gradedSystem`: the core.  From `atomic` (`R 0 → SameAtomicType`), `down`
  (`R (succ α) → R α` for `succ α ≤ height`), `limit` (`R α → R β` for `β < α`, when
  `Order.IsSuccLimit α` and `α ≤ height`), `forth` and `back` (for `succ α ≤ height`, an
  `R (succ α)` pair extends by any point on one side to an `R α` pair), `α ≤ height` and a seed
  `R α n a b`, conclude `BFEquiv α n a b`.
* `bfEquiv_of_gradedMatching`: the same with one lowering law `lower` (`β ≤ α ≤ height` and
  `R α → R β`) in place of `down` and `limit`, and with successors written `α + 1`.
* `bfEquiv_of_nonempty_gradedReceipt`: for a `Type r`-valued family `Receipt` whose laws consume
  a receipt and return `Nonempty` receipts, a seed `Nonempty (Receipt α n a b)` gives
  `BFEquiv α n a b`.
* `bfEquiv_of_gradedReceipt`: the same from an actual receipt `Receipt α n a b`.

## Import boundary

The module imports only `Scott/BackAndForth.lean`: no Karp theory, no Scott-formula or
Scott-sentence construction, no descriptive set theory, no model-theoretic, method, admissible
or conditional module.

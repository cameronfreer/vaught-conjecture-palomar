# Towards the classical `G₀`-dichotomy: independence and positivity machinery

Foundations for the proof of `GSGraphHomHypothesis` (the KST/Miller `G₀`-dichotomy core;
see `InfinitaryLogic/Conditional/SilverCategoryRoute.lean` and
`docs/silver-phase2-route.md`). This file provides the two pillars of the classical
(forcing-free, effective-DST-free) proof:

* **The separation core** (`exists_measurableSet_relIndependent_superset`): for an analytic
  relation `G` on a Polish space, every analytic `G`-independent set is contained in a
  *Borel* `G`-independent set. This is the Kechris–Solecki–Todorcevic lemma, proved here by
  an ω-recursion of Lusin separations (`AnalyticSet.measurablySeparable`): build a
  decreasing sequence of Borel sets `C n ⊇ A`, each separated from the `G`-neighborhood of
  the previous one; the intersection is Borel and independent.

* **The positivity machinery** (`SmallFam`): a family `Φ` of finite assignments `ι → α` is
  *small* if countably many Borel `G`-independent sets capture a value of every member —
  Miller's ideal `I_n` on partial homomorphisms. Smallness is monotone and countably
  additive (`SmallFam.iUnion_of_forall`), giving the pigeonhole
  (`exists_not_smallFam_inter`) used to refine positive families by vertex-value and
  witness-prefix constraints. For the graph `¬r` of a Borel equivalence relation with
  uncountably many classes, the full family is not small (`not_smallFam_univ`): every
  `¬r`-independent set lies in a single class, so a countable capture family would make the
  quotient countable.

* **Combination positivity** (`not_smallFam_comb_cross`, with `not_smallFam_comb_pairs`
  for levels with no fresh constraint): combining pairs of assignments from a positive
  analytic family across a fresh `G`-edge constraint at a designated index yields a
  positive family. This is Miller's "combining pairs of homomorphisms preserves
  `I_n`-positivity": if a countable Borel independent family captured the combined family,
  the assignments avoiding the capture would form a positive analytic family whose values
  at the cross index are `G`-independent, and the KST superset lemma would capture it —
  contradiction. The analyticity side (`analyticSet_comb_pairs`/`analyticSet_comb_cross`)
  keeps the recursion going; the closure facts needed (`AnalyticSet.inter`,
  `AnalyticSet.inter_measurableSet`, `AnalyticSet.prod`) are in
  `InfinitaryLogic/Descriptive/AnalyticClosure.lean`.

The level recursion (vertex-shrinking and witness-extension pigeonholes) and the fusion
extracting the continuous homomorphism build on these in
`InfinitaryLogic/Descriptive/G0Fusion.lean`; see `docs/silver-phase2-route.md` for the
completed proof map.

/-- **Combination positivity across a fresh edge** (the core lemma of the classical
`G₀`-dichotomy; Miller's "combining pairs of homomorphisms preserves `I_n`-positivity"):
combining pairs of assignments from a positive analytic family subject to a fresh `G`-edge
constraint between the values at `s` yields a positive family.

If a countable Borel independent family captured the combined family, the members of `Φ`
avoiding its union would form a positive analytic subfamily `Φ'` (positivity by additivity,
analyticity since the avoided set is Borel); no two members of `Φ'` can satisfy the cross
constraint (the combination would escape the capture), so the values of `Φ'` at `s` form an
analytic `G`-independent set, and the KST superset lemma yields a single Borel independent
set capturing `Φ'` — contradiction. -/

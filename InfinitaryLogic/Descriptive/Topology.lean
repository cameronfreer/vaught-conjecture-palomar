# Product Topology on the Structure Space

This file equips `StructureSpace L` with the product topology (from `RelQuery L → Bool`
with `Bool` discrete) and proves that cylinder sets are clopen.

## Main Results

- `instTopologicalSpaceStructureSpace`: Product topology on `StructureSpace L`.
- `isClopen_relHolds`: The set `{c | c q = true}` is clopen for each query `q`.
- `isOpen_relHolds`, `isClosed_relHolds`: Components of the clopen result.

Since `Bool` has the discrete topology, this is the product of discrete spaces. -/

/-- The set of codes where a given relation query returns `true` is clopen.
This follows from the projection `c ↦ c q` being continuous and `{true}` being
clopen in discrete `Bool`. -/

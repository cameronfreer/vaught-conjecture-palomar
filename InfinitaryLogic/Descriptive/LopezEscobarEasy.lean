# López-Escobar, the easy direction

For arbitrary relational vocabularies the model class of an `L_ω₁ω`-sentence is
PRODUCT-MEASURABLE and ISOMORPHISM-INVARIANT (`modelsOf_measurable_invariant`); for countable
relational vocabularies — where the repository's `BorelSpace`/`StandardBorelSpace
(StructureSpace L)` instances apply — this is an invariant BOREL subset of the standard Borel
structure space (`lopezEscobar_easy`, the literature statement).

Invariance is the named isomorphism-closed predicate `IsomorphismInvariant` (an
`L`-isomorphism of the decoded structures transports membership) — equivalent to invariance
under the logic action (`actionInvariant_iff_isomorphismInvariant`, `Descriptive/LogicAction.lean`).

The hard converse — every isomorphism-invariant Borel class is `L_ω₁ω`-definable, by Marker's
route through Craig interpolation and PC-separation — is **proved**: `lopez_escobar`
(`Methods/LopezEscobar/Separation.lean`), packaged with this direction as `lopezEscobar_iff`
in `Descriptive/LopezEscobar.lean`.

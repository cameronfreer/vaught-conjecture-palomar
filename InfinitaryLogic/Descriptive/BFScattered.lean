# Thinness from countably many back-and-forth classes at every level

A set `K` of codes of countable relational structures is **back-and-forth scattered**
(`BFScattered K`) when, for every countable level `η < ω₁`, the restriction of `CodeBFEquiv η` to
`K` has only countably many classes.  Such a `K` carries no Cantor antichain for isomorphism
(`not_hasCantorAntichainOn_of_bfScattered`, for every relational language), and, for countably
many relation symbols, it is thin: it contains no nonempty perfect set of pairwise
non-isomorphic codes (`isThinOn_of_bfScattered`).  The class `K` is arbitrary; no analyticity,
Borelness or isomorphism invariance of `K` is assumed.

## Main declarations

* `codeBFEquivSetoid L η`: `CodeBFEquiv η` as an equivalence relation on all codes.
* `BFScattered K`: every level `η < ω₁` has countably many classes on `K`; it passes to subsets
  (`BFScattered.mono`).
* `exists_forall_not_codeBFEquiv_of_analyticSet`: an analytic set of pairwise non-isomorphic
  codes is separated pairwise at one level `η < ω₁`.
* `not_hasCantorAntichainOn_of_bfScattered`: no Cantor antichain, with no countability of the
  language.
* `isThinOn_of_bfScattered`: thinness, for countably many relation symbols.
* `bfScattered_of_countable_bfObservations`: observation maps with countably many realized
  values at every level, whose equal values imply `CodeBFEquiv`, give `BFScattered`; with the
  two endpoints `not_hasCantorAntichainOn_of_countable_bfObservations` and
  `isThinOn_of_countable_bfObservations`.  These are adapters over `BFScattered`, not a new
  proof of the separation route.

The form for the models of a sentence, with the hypothesis read through `bfEquivSetoid φ η`, is
`Sentenceω.isThinOnNatModels_of_bfScattered` in `Descriptive/BFScatteredSentence.lean`, kept
apart so that this module does not import the counting theory.

## The proof

Let `f` be a continuous map from Cantor space into `K` sending distinct points to
non-isomorphic codes.

1. The range of `f` is analytic (a continuous image of the Polish space `ℕ → Bool`), so its
   off-diagonal, the pairs of distinct points of the range, is analytic
   (`MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet.offDiag`, in the Hausdorff space of codes), and it contains no
   isomorphic pair (`not_structureIso_of_mem_offDiag`).
2. Uniform back-and-forth separation (`exists_uniform_bfSeparation`) applied to that off-diagonal
   gives one level `η < ω₁` at which no two distinct points of the range are back-and-forth
   equivalent (`exists_forall_not_codeBFEquiv_of_analyticSet`).
3. Hence `x ↦ [f x]`, the class of `f x` in the quotient of `K` by the restriction of
   `codeBFEquivSetoid L η`, is injective.  That quotient is countable by hypothesis, while Cantor
   space is not.

Thinness follows: a perfect antichain in a complete metric space yields a Cantor antichain
(`IsThinOn.of_no_cantorAntichain`).

## Interpretation choices

* **Classes, not codes.**  The hypothesis counts the classes of the restriction of
  `CodeBFEquiv η` to `K` (the quotient of the subtype `K` by the pulled-back relation).  A single
  class can contain uncountably many codes, so this is weaker than countability of `K`.
* **Equivalence convention.**  The level-`η` relation is this library's `CodeBFEquiv η`:
  back-and-forth equivalence of the empty tuples, with single-element extension steps.  No
  comparison with other hierarchies of infinitary equivalence is made or used.
* **Levels.**  The separating level is exactly the one returned by
  `exists_uniform_bfSeparation`: an `Ordinal.{0}` below `Ordinal.omega 1`, with no lift and no
  offset.
* **Countability of the language.**  `[Countable (Σ l, L.Relations l)]` is used once, in
  `isThinOn_of_bfScattered` (and passed on by its adapter
  `isThinOn_of_countable_bfObservations`), to equip the space of codes with a complete metric
  (it is Polish) so that a perfect antichain yields a Cantor antichain.  The Cantor-antichain
  theorem, the separation lemma, the setoid and `BFScattered` need no countability: analyticity
  of the off-diagonal needs only that the space of codes is Hausdorff, and
  `exists_uniform_bfSeparation` assumes no countability; nor do the observation bridge and its
  Cantor-antichain corollary.
* **Observations.**  The observation adapters use only that equal observations imply
  `CodeBFEquiv η` and that the realized values are countable: no measurable structure on the
  target, no invariance, no surjectivity, no countability of the whole target type.
* **No definability of `K`.**  The analytic set fed to the separation theorem is built from the
  Cantor antichain, not from `K`.

/-! ### Countable observations -/

/-- **Countably many observed values at every level give back-and-forth scatteredness.**  For
each `η < ω₁`, let `obs η : C → Q η` be an observation whose realized values on `C` form a
countable set, and suppose that equal observations at level `η` imply `CodeBFEquiv η`.  Then `C`
is back-and-forth scattered.

Only the forward implication (equal observations imply back-and-forth equivalence) is used; the
converse is not assumed, so `obs η` need not descend to the back-and-forth classes.  At each
level this is `countable_quotient_of_countable_range` for the restriction of
`codeBFEquivSetoid L η` to `C`: the countable set of realized values surjects onto its classes,
each class being hit by the observation of any of its members.

Hypotheses deliberately absent:
* No countability of the relation symbols.
* No measurability or analyticity of `C`.
* No measurable structure on `Q η`, and no measurability of `obs η`.
* No invariance of observations under isomorphism.
* No countability of the whole target type: only its realized image is countable.
* No surjectivity, nonemptiness, sentence recovery, or orbit definability.
* No assertion that equality of observations is equivalent to BF equivalence: only the
  displayed forward implication is needed.

The target universe `w'` is independent of the universes of the language. -/

countability. -/

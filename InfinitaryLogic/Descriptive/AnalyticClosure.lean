# Closure properties of analytic sets

Closure properties of analytic sets that Mathlib lacks: finite intersections
(`MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet.inter`, and `MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet.inter_measurableSet` for
intersection with a Borel set), products (`MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet.prod`), and off-diagonals
in a Hausdorff space (`MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet.offDiag`).  The
statements are Mathlib-shaped; they are used by the `G₀` dichotomy
(`InfinitaryLogic/Descriptive/G0Dichotomy.lean`), by the back-and-forth separation
(`InfinitaryLogic/Descriptive/BFSeparation.lean`), and by thinness from countably many
back-and-forth classes (`InfinitaryLogic/Descriptive/BFScattered.lean`).

# Thinness from a countable-ordinal rank

The standard route to thinness: equip the points with a rank below `ω₁`, know that each
fixed-rank antichain is countable, and know that a Cantor antichain has bounded rank.  Then a
Cantor antichain would be a countable union of countable sets while being of size continuum.

`ThinRankAnalysis` bundles exactly that **evidence**.  `no_cantorAntichain` and `isThinOn` are
derived from it, not fields: a structure whose fields already asserted the conclusion would
prove nothing.

The Cantor-antichain hypothesis is the **refined** one: the rank need only be bounded on a
continuously and injectively embedded Cantor *subcopy* of the antichain, not on the whole of it.
That is all the countability contradiction consumes, and it is markedly easier to supply.
`ThinRankAnalysis.of_bounded_on_cantor_antichains` recovers the structure from a bound on the whole
antichain, for producers that happen to have one.

`Setoid.countable_antichain` is the elementary quotient step, factored out because it is
independent of any rank and useful on its own.

/-- **The slicing contradiction**, on a single antichain with a rank bound.

Factored out so `no_cantorAntichain` can apply it to the *subcopy* the refined field supplies,
without the argument being written twice.  It uses membership, pairwise inequivalence (hence
injectivity), fixed-rank countability, and the rank bound; it has no topological hypothesis. -/

are bounded; that subcopy is the union, over the countably many ordinals below the bound, of
fixed-rank antichains — each countable — hence countable, while being a continuous injective image
of Cantor space.

Continuity of `e` is not consumed here — only its injectivity is, to keep the composite an
antichain.  The field promises continuity because that is what makes the subcopy a genuine Cantor
subcopy, which is what a producer must supply and other consumers may need. -/

/-- **Compatibility with a bound on the whole antichain.**  A producer that can bound the rank on
*every* Cantor antichain — the stronger, older hypothesis — is a ranked thinness analysis: take the
subcopy to be the identity.

Only this direction is supplied, and no converse is claimed: a bound on some subcopy does not
recover one on the whole antichain, which is exactly why the field was weakened.

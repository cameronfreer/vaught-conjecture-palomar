# Standard Borel Structure on the Model Class

This file shows that `ModelsOf φ` (the set of coded ℕ-models of an Lω₁ω sentence φ)
inherits `StandardBorelSpace` as a measurable subspace of the structure space.

## Main Results

- `modelsOf_isClopenable`: `ModelsOf φ` is clopenable (admits a finer Polish
  topology making it clopen).
- `modelsOf_standardBorel`: The subtype `↥(ModelsOf φ)` is standard Borel.

/-- `ModelsOf φ` is clopenable in the structure space: there exists a finer Polish
topology making it both open and closed. This follows from `ModelsOf φ` being
measurable in a Polish + Borel space. -/

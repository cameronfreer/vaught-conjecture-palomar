# Thinness from single-sentence splits on a presentation of the classes

`thin_of_countable_sentence_spectra` derives thinness from countably many realized truth
sequences for every countable list of sentences, on codes.  A classification argument
naturally delivers something stated on a **presentation** of the isomorphism classes rather
than on codes: a type `Q`, a map `classOf : C → Q`, and a truth predicate `truth` that is actual
satisfaction read back through `classOf`, such that for each single sentence one of its two
truth sides contains only countably many points of `Q`.

* `countable_sentenceTheory_image_of_splits` (the bridge): single-sentence splits on the
  presentation give countably many realized truth sequences on `C` for every sentence list.
  Off the countable union of the exceptional sides, the whole truth sequence is constant
  (`countable_range_of_splits`), and `htruth` transfers the count to the codes.
* `isThinOn_of_countable_sentence_splits`: thinness of `C`, through the arbitrary-class
  recovery argument `isThinOn_of_countable_sentence_spectra`.
* `Sentenceω.isThinOnNatModels_of_countable_sentence_splits`: the sentence-specific corollary.

`Q` is any type presenting `C`.  `classOf` need not be surjective, injective, or measurable; no
σ-algebra on `Q` is assumed or produced.  No hypothesis that equality in `Q` reflects or preserves
isomorphism is imposed or used (under the countable-signature endpoint's assumptions, satisfaction
compatibility does imply reflection through Scott sentences; the proof neither establishes nor
uses that).  Only `htruth` and `hsplit` are used.  Nothing here needs Silver, ranks, Scott
isolation, or Borelness of `C`.

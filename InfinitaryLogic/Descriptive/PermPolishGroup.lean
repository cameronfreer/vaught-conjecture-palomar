# `S∞ = Equiv.Perm ℕ` is a Polish topological group (issue #27, commit 2)

Building on the pointwise-convergence topology of `PermTopology.lean`:

- `Equiv.Perm ℕ` is a **Polish space**, as a closed subspace of `(ℕ → ℕ) × (ℕ → ℕ)` via the pair
  embedding (`NatPerm.isClosedEmbedding_embed`).
- Multiplication `(σ, τ) ↦ σ * τ` and inversion `σ ↦ σ⁻¹` are **continuous**, so `Equiv.Perm ℕ` is
  a topological group (`IsTopologicalGroup`).

Continuity of multiplication factors coordinatewise through `NatPerm.continuous_evalComp`:
`(σ * τ) n = σ (τ n)` evaluates `σ` at the continuously varying discrete index `τ n`. Inversion is
immediate: the pair embedding intertwines it with `Prod.swap`.

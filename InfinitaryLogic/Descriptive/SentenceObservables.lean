# Borel observables are sentence truths

Relative López–Escobar for Borel families of structures, allowing repetitions and
non-isomorphic members with the same observable.  Everything here is below Silver: the only
input is `sentence_pullback_of_iso_compatible`.

* `sentences_recover_observable`: a measurable Cantor-valued invariant `p` of a Borel family `f`
  is exactly `sentenceTheory θ (f x)` for some countable sentence list `θ`.
* `sentences_encode_observable`: the target may be any countably separated measurable space,
  through a measurable injection into Cantor space.
* `sentence_classification_iff_borel_classification`: on a Borel class, a Borel complete
  invariant exists iff a complete countable list of sentences does.

No selector of representatives is built, and no Borel map into the syntax of sentences is
claimed: the sentence list exists for the chosen observable, by classical choice.  The
thinness corollary (a Borel complete invariant on a thin class forces countably many classes)
needs the spectrum characterization and lives in `Conditional/SentenceSpectrum.lean`.

## Classical background

Countable separating families and Borel complete invariants: Gao, *Invariant Descriptive Set
Theory* (CRC Press, 2009), Proposition 5.4.4.  The observable-recovery statements here are
derived from the project's sentence-recovery API and are not claimed to occur in that form in
the source.

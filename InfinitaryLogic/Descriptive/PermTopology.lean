# The pointwise-convergence topology on `S∞ = Equiv.Perm ℕ` (issue #27, commit 1)

The infinite symmetric group `Equiv.Perm ℕ` carries a canonical Polish topology — the topology of
pointwise convergence. Mathlib puts no topology on `Equiv.Perm ℕ`, so we install it here via the
**pair embedding**
```
embed : Equiv.Perm ℕ → (ℕ → ℕ) × (ℕ → ℕ),   embed σ = (⇑σ, ⇑σ⁻¹)
```
into a product of two copies of Baire space `ℕ → ℕ`. The image is the closed set of pairs of
mutually inverse functions, so `embed` is a closed embedding — the route to Polishness (commit 2).

## Main results

- `NatPerm.embed`, `instTopologicalSpacePermNat`: the pair embedding and the induced topology.
- `NatPerm.isClosedEmbedding_embed`: `embed` is a closed embedding, cut out by the two inverse
  equations (`NatPerm.range_embed`, `NatPerm.isClosed_range_embed`).
- `NatPerm.continuous_apply_perm`, `NatPerm.continuous_inv_apply`: the evaluations `σ ↦ σ n` and
  `σ ↦ σ⁻¹ n` are continuous.
- `NatPerm.isClopen_stab` and `NatPerm.hasBasis_nhds`: the **acceptance lemma** — the finite
  pointwise stabilizers `{σ | ∀ i ∈ s, σ i = σ₀ i}` are clopen and form a neighborhood basis at
  every `σ₀`. This pins the induced topology to the intended pointwise one (the pair embedding
  could a priori be finer).

## Design

`NatPerm.continuous_evalComp` is the reusable primitive underlying continuity throughout this
tranche: evaluating a continuous function-valued map at a *continuously varying discrete index* is
continuous, because the index can be frozen on a clopen neighborhood. It powers the closed-range
computation here and the continuity of multiplication (commit 2) and of the logic action
(commit 3).

/-- **Localized evaluation.** If `f : X → I → Y` is continuous and `e : X → I` is continuous into a
discrete space `I`, then `x ↦ f x (e x)` is continuous: near any `x₀` the index `e x` is frozen at
`e x₀` on the clopen set `e ⁻¹' {e x₀}`, where the map reduces to the continuous `x ↦ f x (e x₀)`. -/

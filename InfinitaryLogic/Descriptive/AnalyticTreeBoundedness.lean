# Boundedness for analytic families of well-founded trees

An analytic family of well-founded trees on `ℕ`, whose node sets are closed, has heights bounded
by a single countable ordinal.  The proof is descriptive and self-contained: a continuous
parametrization by Baire space, one countable witness tree that dominates every tree of the
family, and the countability of the height of a well-founded tree.  It uses only the definition
of analytic sets, convergence in Baire space and the regularity of `ℵ₁`; no boundedness theorem
for well-orders is involved.

## Main declarations

* `KleeneBrouwer.analytic_tree_rank_bounded`: for an analytic `A ⊆ X` and `T : X → tree ℕ` with
  every node set `{x | s ∈ T x}` closed and `T x` well-founded on `A`, some `β < ω₁` strictly
  bounds `treeHeight (T x)` for every `x ∈ A`.

The helpers it consumes live with their subjects: `InfinitaryLogic.rank_le_rank_of_relHom`
(`OrdinalUtil`), and `hasInfiniteBranch_iff_exists_seq`, `treeHeight_le_of_relHom` and
`treeHeight_lt_omega1` (`KleeneBrouwer`).

## The witness tree

Write `A` as the range of a continuous `f : (ℕ → ℕ) → X` (the empty case is immediate).  A node
of the witness tree `W` is a list of `Nat.pair` codes of pairs `(s i, u i)` such that some `y`
extending `u` has `s ∈ T (f y)`; it is prefix-closed because the trees `T (f y)` are.

* `W` is well-founded.  Take a branch, with first coordinates `x` and second coordinates `y`,
  and for each stage `n` a witness `yₙ` extending `y|n` with `x|n ∈ T (f yₙ)`.  Fix a length `k`.
  For every stage `n ≥ k`, prefix closure of `T (f yₙ)` puts `yₙ` in the fixed set
  `{z | x|k ∈ T (f z)}`, which is closed as the preimage of a closed node set under `f`.  Since
  `yₙ → y` in Baire space, the limit `y` lies in that set: `x|k ∈ T (f y)` for every `k`, an
  infinite branch of `T (f y)`, although `f y ∈ A`.
* For `y : ℕ → ℕ`, the map `s ↦ (s, y|s.length)` is a homomorphism of strict extension from
  `T (f y)` to `W`, so `treeHeight (T (f y)) ≤ treeHeight W`; it is injective (the first
  coordinates recover `s`), but `treeHeight_le_of_relHom` does not use injectivity.  As `W` is a
  well-founded tree on `ℕ`, `treeHeight W < ω₁`, and `β = treeHeight W + 1` works.

## Interpretation choices

* **Closed node sets.**  The hypothesis is that each `{x | s ∈ T x}` is closed, not necessarily
  clopen, so the assignment `x ↦ T x` need not be continuous.  Closedness is what the limit step
  uses, pulled back along the parametrization.  Measurable node sets on a Polish space are not
  treated here.
* **The explicit limit step.**  Membership of the limit is obtained from witnesses at all
  sufficiently long stages lying in one fixed closed set (`IsClosed.mem_of_tendsto`), not from a
  compactness or König argument.
* **Rank convention.**  `treeHeight T = ⨆ x, succ (rank x)` for the rank of strict extension, so
  the empty tree has height `0` and the root-only tree height `1`; the bound is strict.
* **Universes.**  Heights and the bound live in `Ordinal.{0}`; the parameter space `X` is in any
  universe.
* **Namespace.**  The theorem is stated in `KleeneBrouwer`, the namespace of `treeHeight`,
  `extBelow` and `HasInfiniteBranch`, which it is about.

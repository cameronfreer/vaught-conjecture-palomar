# Uniform back-and-forth separation of analytic sets of non-isomorphic pairs

If `A` is an analytic set of pairs of codes of countable relational structures and no pair in
`A` is isomorphic, then a single countable back-and-forth level separates every pair of `A`:
there is `α < ω₁` with `¬ CodeBFEquiv α c d` for every `(c, d) ∈ A`.  The proof is descriptive
boundedness applied to the forced back-and-forth trees: the trees `bfTree c d` with
`(c, d) ∈ A` form an analytic family of well-founded trees with closed node sets, so their
heights are bounded by one `α < ω₁`, and `CodeBFEquiv α c d` would put `α` strictly below the
height of `bfTree c d`.  No sentence, coding of sentences, or boundedness theorem for
well-orders is involved.

## Main declarations

* `exists_uniform_bfSeparation`: an analytic isomorphism-free set of pairs is separated at one
  back-and-forth level `α < ω₁`.
* `exists_uniform_bfSeparation_forall_ge`: the same level separates at every higher level.
* `exists_uniform_bfSeparation_of_analyticSets`: for analytic `B` and `C` with no element of `B`
  isomorphic to an element of `C`, one level `α < ω₁` separates every `x ∈ B` from every
  `y ∈ C`.

## Interpretation choices

* **Universes.**  `L : Language.{u, v}` is arbitrary and only `[L.IsRelational]` is assumed.
  The carrier is `ℕ`, so tree heights, the bound and the back-and-forth levels are all
  `Ordinal.{0}`, and no lift appears.
* **No countability of symbols.**  Analyticity refers to the product topology on
  `StructureSpace L × StructureSpace L`, which exists for every `L` (`AnalyticSet` needs only a
  topology), and the node conditions of `bfTree` are closed for every relational `L`
  (`isClosed_setOf_mem_bfTree`).  Countably many relation symbols are needed only to *produce*
  analytic sets from Borel ones, which is not done here.
* **Rank convention.**  Inherited from `BFTree`: ranks are those of strict extension and
  `treeHeight T = ⨆ x, succ (rank x)`, so `CodeBFEquiv α c d` gives
  `α < treeHeight (bfTree c d)` (`lt_treeHeight_bfTree_of_codeBFEquiv`); with the strict
  height bound `treeHeight (bfTree c d) < α` from `KleeneBrouwer.analytic_tree_rank_bounded`,
  the level `α` itself separates, with no offset.
* **Isomorphism.**  Non-isomorphism is stated through `structureIsoSetoid L`; no invariance
  predicate is assumed or produced.
* **Products of analytic sets.**  Mathlib has no product lemma for analytic sets; the
  two-set form uses `MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet.prod` from `AnalyticClosure` (Mathlib-only
  imports), stated there for arbitrary topological spaces.

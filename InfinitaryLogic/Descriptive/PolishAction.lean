# The Polish logic action of `S∞` on the structure space (issue #27, commit 3)

The capstone: the algebraic action of `S∞ = Equiv.Perm ℕ` on `StructureSpace L` (from
`LogicAction.lean`) is **jointly continuous** for the pointwise topology on `Equiv.Perm ℕ`
(`PermPolishGroup.lean`) and the *existing* product topology on `StructureSpace L`
(`Topology.lean`) — packaged as a `ContinuousSMul` instance. Together with the Polish structures
already in place this exhibits `StructureSpace L` as a **Polish `S∞`-space**.

## Main results

- `FirstOrder.Language.continuous_smul_action` and the `ContinuousSMul` instance: the action
  `(σ, c) ↦ σ • c` is jointly continuous. No countability or relationality hypothesis is needed.
- `FirstOrder.Language.isPolishSInftySpace`: under `[Countable (Σ l, L.Relations l)]`,
  `StructureSpace L` is a Polish `S∞`-space — `Equiv.Perm ℕ` is a Polish topological group,
  `StructureSpace L` is Polish, and the action is continuous.

## Design

Joint continuity factors coordinatewise, exactly as anticipated: for a fixed relation query
`⟨R, v⟩`, the value `(σ • c) ⟨R, v⟩ = c ⟨R, σ⁻¹ ∘ v⟩` reads `c` at a query whose tuple depends on
`σ` through the finitely many *continuous* evaluations `σ⁻¹ (v i)`. On the clopen neighborhood where
those are frozen, the map reduces to a single continuous evaluation of `c`. The countability
hypothesis for Polishness of `StructureSpace L` lives only in the final packaging — never on the
action, the algebra, or the orbit equivalence.

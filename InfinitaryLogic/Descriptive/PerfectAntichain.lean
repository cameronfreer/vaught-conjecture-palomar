# Perfect and Cantor antichains, and thinness

The vocabulary a dichotomy theorem is stated in, separated from any particular dichotomy.

* `HasPerfectAntichainOn r A` — a nonempty perfect subset of `A` of pairwise `r`-inequivalent
  points;
* `HasCantorAntichainOn r A` — a *continuous* Cantor-space parametrization of such an antichain,
  the constructive form the Cantor-scheme builders actually produce;
* `IsThinOn r A` — the negation of the first.

The two positive forms are related by `HasPerfectAntichainOn.hasCantorAntichainOn`, which is
`Perfect.exists_nat_bool_injection` plus bookkeeping.  Injectivity of a Cantor antichain is not
an extra hypothesis: it follows from *reflexivity* of the setoid, since distinct arguments have
inequivalent images and every point is equivalent to itself.

The file also carries the cardinal facts these statements are measured against: a nonempty
perfect set in a complete, second-countable metric space has size continuum
(`Perfect.mk_eq_continuum`, which lives in the topology-only module
`InfinitaryLogic/Topology/Perfect.lean`, imported here); a perfect transversal forces
continuum-many classes (`continuum_classes_of_perfect_transversal`,
with its two-sided companion); and a Polish space, hence any quotient of one, has at most
continuum-many points (`mk_le_continuum_of_polish`, `mk_quotient_le_continuum_of_polish`).
None of them mentions a dichotomy, an equivalence relation being closed, or a splitting
hypothesis.  It also carries the purely set-theoretic `countable_quotient_of_countable_range`: a
quotient is countable when a map with countable range refines the relation.

**Hypotheses are kept minimal, and the ordering below is what makes that possible.**  Only three
results need `SecondCountableTopology`: the two Polish cardinality bounds and the *upper* half of
`Perfect.mk_eq_continuum`.  Everything else needs at most `MetricSpace` + `CompleteSpace` (for the
Cantor injection) or nothing beyond `TopologicalSpace`.  In particular
`continuum_classes_of_perfect_transversal` is proved through the Cantor antichain rather than
through `mk_eq_continuum`, which is what lets it drop second countability — it only ever needed
the lower bound.

/-! ### Adapters that need no metric structure -/

variable {r : Setoid X} {A B : Set X}

/-- Enlarging the ambient set preserves a Cantor antichain.  Keeping this separate is what lets
the scheme wrappers below conclude at the scheme's own root rather than carrying a containment
hypothesis. -/
theorem HasCantorAntichainOn.mono (h : HasCantorAntichainOn r A) (hAB : A ⊆ B) :
    HasCantorAntichainOn r B := by
  obtain ⟨f, hcont, hmem, hineq⟩ := h
  exact ⟨f, hcont, fun x => hAB (hmem x), hineq⟩

/-- **A Cantor antichain for a coarser relation is one for a finer relation.**

`hrs` says `r` **refines** `s`: being `r`-related implies being `s`-related, so `r` cuts the space
into the finer classes.  Separating points for the coarser `s` is therefore the *stronger*
requirement, and it survives the passage to `r`.

The direction is easy to reverse mentally, so concretely: with `r := isoSetoid φ` and
`s := bfEquivSetoid φ α`, isomorphic models are back-and-forth equivalent, so a family that is
pairwise BF-**in**equivalent is in particular pairwise non-isomorphic. -/
theorem HasCantorAntichainOn.mono_relation {r s : Setoid X} (hrs : ∀ x y, r.r x y → s.r x y)
    (h : HasCantorAntichainOn s A) : HasCantorAntichainOn r A := by
  obtain ⟨f, hcont, hmem, hineq⟩ := h
  exact ⟨f, hcont, hmem, fun x y hxy hr => hineq x y hxy (hrs _ _ hr)⟩

/-- **A Cantor antichain on a subtype is one on the underlying set.**

The subtype carries `r` pulled back along the inclusion, and it *is* the ambient set seen from
inside, so the containment clause is vacuous there and becomes membership in `A` here.  Only
continuity has to move, and it moves by composing with the inclusion.

This is the return leg for anything proved on the model subtype — where a Polish structure is
available — when the statement to be established is about the ambient space. -/

omit [TopologicalSpace X] in
/-- **A Cantor antichain survives coarsening the topology.**

Of the three clauses only continuity is topological, and continuity into a coarser topology is
just composition with the identity.  This is the direction needed to carry a witness built in a
Polish refinement — the kind `PolishSpace.IsClopenable` supplies — back to the ambient space.

It is also why no theorem about *perfectness* surviving coarsening is required: coarsening is
applied to the Cantor antichain, where it is cheap, and perfectness is recovered afterwards in
the ambient space by `HasCantorAntichainOn.hasPerfectAntichainOn`. -/

/-- A Cantor antichain is injective.

The inequivalence clause is deliberately **not** restated in the conclusion: it is already the
content of `h`, and a consumer needing it should unpack `h`.  One job per adapter. -/

needs no metric or completeness assumption — only that the ambient space is Hausdorff. -/

/-- **Cantor space has no isolated points.**

Stated as the bare accumulation-point fact rather than as a `PerfectSpace (ℕ → Bool)` instance:
this Mathlib pin supplies no such instance (its only ones require `ConnectedSpace`, or a module
over a field), and a global orphan instance here would be liable to collide with one added
upstream later.

A neighbourhood in the product topology constrains only finitely many coordinates, so some
coordinate is left free; flipping it moves the point without leaving the neighbourhood. -/

  · exact Bool.not_ne_self (x n) (Function.update_self n (!x n) x ▸ congrFun hEq n)

/-- **A Cantor antichain is a perfect antichain.**

The range is closed because a continuous injection out of a compact space into a Hausdorff one is
a closed embedding; and it inherits Cantor space's lack of isolated points by transporting
accumulation points along that injection.  No metric, completeness, or second-countability
assumption is needed — only `T2Space`. -/

    and it has no isolated points because accumulation points transport along that injection.

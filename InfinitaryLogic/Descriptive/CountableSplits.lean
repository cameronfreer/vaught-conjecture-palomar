# Countably many predicates with countable truth sides

Set-theoretic counting with no topology.  The first two lemmas assume nothing about `X` (no
nonemptiness or uncountability); the third assumes `X` uncountable.  For countably many
predicates `P i` on `X`, each with a countable truth side (`{x | P i x}` or `{x | ¬ P i x}`
countable):

* `exists_countable_exceptions_of_splits`: outside one countable exceptional set every `P i` is
  constant, so all the predicates are decided simultaneously off that set.
* `countable_range_of_splits`: any map out of `X` that depends only on the truth values of the
  `P i` has countable range: the countable exceptional set contributes countably many values,
  and its complement contributes at most one.
* `constant_off_countable_of_splits`: on an uncountable `X`, a map whose values are separated by
  countably many tests, each with a countable side, is constant outside a countable set.

The descriptive consumer is the sentence-splits bridge (`Descriptive/SentenceSplits.lean`), where
the predicates are the truths of countably many sentences on a presentation of isomorphism
classes.

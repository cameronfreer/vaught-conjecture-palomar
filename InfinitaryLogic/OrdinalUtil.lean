# Small ordinal facts

Neutral helpers about countable ordinals, used by the Scott refinement count, the Borel
`BFEquiv` analysis, and the ranked-thinness package, together with the comparison of
`WellFounded.rank` along a relation homomorphism (`rank_le_rank_of_relHom`, not necessarily
injective) used for tree heights. Nothing here is specific to infinitary logic, descriptive set
theory, or any one of those consumers.  It also records the greatest attainable stage
(`exists_forall_iff_le_of_bounded_of_isSuccLimit_closed`): a downward-closed property of ordinals
holding at `0`, closed at successor limits and bounded, holds exactly up to a last, attained
stage, with a convenience form below `ω₁`.

Both shapes of the countability statement are provided: `Set.Countable (Set.Iio β)` and the
`Countable` *instance* on the coercion, since consumers need one or the other and converting
at each site is noise.

The greatest-attainable-stage lemma was offered for upstreaming by a consumer of this library.

/-! ## The greatest attainable stage -/

/-- **The greatest attainable stage.**  Let `P` be a property of ordinals ("`ξ` is a stage")
that holds at `0`, is closed downward, and is closed at successor limits.  If every stage is
at most `A`, then there is a last stage `ρ ≤ A`, it is attained (`P ρ`), and the stages are
exactly the ordinals `ξ ≤ ρ`.

This turns "the stages are bounded" into "there is a last stage and it is attained".
Boundedness alone gives neither: `P α ↔ α < ω` is bounded by `ω`, downward closed and holds
at `0`, but has no greatest stage, and `ω` itself is not a stage; closure at successor limits is
what fails there.  The supplied bound `A` need not itself be attainable: only `ρ ≤ A` is
returned.

No countability is used; this general form is the primary statement.
`exists_isGreatest_setOf_of_bounded_of_isSuccLimit_closed` restates it with `IsGreatest`, and
`exists_greatest_stage_lt_omega1` is the convenience form below `ω₁`. -/

/-- **The greatest attainable stage**, as `IsGreatest`: under the hypotheses of
`exists_forall_iff_le_of_bounded_of_isSuccLimit_closed`, the set of stages has a greatest
element, and it lies at or below the supplied bound `A` (which need not be a stage). -/
theorem exists_isGreatest_setOf_of_bounded_of_isSuccLimit_closed (P : Ordinal.{u} → Prop)
    (hzero : P 0) (hdown : ∀ {α β}, α ≤ β → P β → P α)

    exists_forall_iff_le_of_bounded_of_isSuccLimit_closed P hzero hdown hlim hbound
  exact ⟨ρ, hρA, hρ, fun ξ hξ ↦ (hiff ξ).mp hξ⟩

/-- **The greatest attainable stage, from hypotheses below `ω₁`.**  Limit closure is asked only
at limits `l < ω₁`, and the bound `A < ω₁` is asked to dominate only the countable stages.  The
conclusion is the full one of `exists_forall_iff_le_of_bounded_of_isSuccLimit_closed`: there is
a last stage `ρ ≤ A`, it is attained, and the stages are exactly the ordinals `ξ ≤ ρ`; as there,
`A` need not be a stage.

Restricting the conclusion to `ξ < ω₁` is unnecessary, because downward closure is global: a
stage at or above `ω₁` would make `succ A < ω₁` a stage.  The restricted shape
`∀ ξ, ξ < Ordinal.omega 1 → (P ξ ↔ ξ ≤ ρ)` follows by specialisation.

`ω₁` is inessential (it is used only to know that `succ A < ω₁`); the general form is primary,
and this one is a convenience in the project's `Ordinal.omega 1` convention for countable
ordinals.  It is the general form applied to `ξ ↦ ξ < ω₁ ∧ P ξ`. -/

/-! ## Rank is monotone along relation homomorphisms -/

/-- **Rank under a relation homomorphism.**  If `f : r →r s` sends every `r`-step to an `s`-step,
then the `r`-rank of `a` is at most the `s`-rank of `f a`.  No injectivity is assumed: distinct
points may share an image, since only the steps below `a` are transported. -/

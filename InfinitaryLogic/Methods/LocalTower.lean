# The countable local Skolem tower `Llocal` / `Γlocal`

`localSkolem L Γ` (in `LocalSkolem.lean`) adjoins a Skolem function symbol only for the formulas of a
**countable** family `Γ`, and so stays countable. But one layer is not closed under its own witness
formulas, so — exactly as `skolemStage`/`skolemColim` do for the *uncountable* full Skolemization —
we iterate. The difference is that here the family `Γ` grows *in lock-step* with the language, so the
language and the family are **mutually recursive**:

* `L₀ = L`, `Γ₀` = the seed family;
* `L_{k+1} = L_k.sum (localSkolem L_k (skolemNeed Γ_k))` — adjoin Skolem symbols for the
  **Skolem-need family** `skolemNeed Γ_k = Γ_k ∪ {¬ψ | ∀ψ ∈ Γ_k}`: the EM truth lemma's `all` case
  consumes the witness symbol of the *negated body* `¬ψ` (cf. `skWitnessStep` in
  `SkolemClosure.lean` and `skWitnessTerm … ψ₀.not` in `EMTermModel.lean`), so Skolemizing `Γ_k`
  alone would miss exactly the symbol the rebased truth lemma needs;
* `Γ_{k+1}` = the subformula/component closure of a seed built from `skolemNeed Γ_k` (lifted along
  the language inclusion), the Skolem-witness bodies of the new symbols, and a reserved
  deForm-closure slot.

The mutual recursion is packaged as a single `ℕ`-indexed sequence of `LocalStage` bundles (language +
family + countability certificates), sidestepping dependent-recursion sprawl. The **deliverable of
this chunk** is that every stage is countable — both the language's symbol types and the family
`Γ_k` — which is what keeps the eventual local colimit `L_Γ` countable (the fatal size problem that
`localSkolem` was introduced to fix). The local colimit, its cocone inclusions, and the transported
countability live in `LocalColimit.lean`; here we stop at the tower and its stagewise countability.

/-! ### Countability of `Language.sum` symbol types

A sum language's arity-graded symbol type is the fibrewise disjoint sum, so its total `Σ`-type is
countable as soon as both summands' `Σ`-types are. These feed the successor-language countability
certificate in `LocalStage.succ`. -/

/-! ### The local Skolem witness term and formula

For a symbol of `localSkolem L Γ` — that is, a formula `φ ∈ Γ` of arity `n+1` — the witness body of
`∃ xₙ, φ` is `φ[skolemTerm]`, built with the template pattern `openBounds → subst → relabel` exactly
as `skolemWitnessFormula` does in `SkolemClosure.lean`, but using the *local* Skolem symbol (which
exists precisely because `φ ∈ Γ`). This is the arity-`n` formula, over `L.sum (localSkolem L Γ)`,
added to the successor family. -/

/-- The **local Skolem witness term** for the symbol `sym` (a formula `φ ∈ Γ` of arity `n+1`): the
function symbol `sym` — in the `localSkolem` summand — applied to the argument terms `ts`, as a term
of `L.sum (localSkolem L Γ)`. Local analogue of `skolemTerm`. -/
def localSkolemTerm {Γ : Set (Σ n, L.BoundedFormulaω Empty n)} {γ : Type*} {n : ℕ}

  Term.func (Sum.inr sym : (L.sum (localSkolem L Γ)).Functions n) ts

/-- The **local Skolem witness formula** for the symbol `sym` (a formula `φ ∈ Γ` of arity `n+1`):
substitute the local Skolem term for the witnessed last variable of `φ`, yielding the arity-`n`
formula `φ[skolemTerm]` over `L.sum (localSkolem L Γ)`. Local analogue of `skolemWitnessFormula`. -/

/-! ### The Skolem-need family: `Γ` plus the negated bodies of its universals

The EM truth lemma's `all` case for `∀ψ` uses the Skolem witness of the **negation** of the body:
`skWitnessTerm … ψ.not` (mirroring `skWitnessStep` in the full `Γ*`, which adds the witness body of
`¬ψ` for every `.all ψ`). So the successor language must carry a local Skolem symbol for `¬ψ`, not
just for the members of `Γ` themselves. `skolemNeed Γ` is the countable enlargement that provisions
exactly these symbols. -/

/-- The negated body contributed by a single family member: a universal `∀ψ` (arity `n`)
contributes `¬ψ` (arity `n+1`) — the formula whose local Skolem symbol the EM `all`-case consumes;
every other form contributes nothing. -/

/-! ### Seed of the successor family

The seed of `Γ_{k+1}` (before the subformula/component closure) has three parts. Each is countable
when `Γ` is, so the whole seed is. -/

/-- **Reserved deForm-closure seed** (placeholder). The truth lemma's family must be closed under the
*de-substituted* formulas `deForm S φ ts` of its members; but `deForm` is defined over a term-model
carrier `J` (see `EMTermModel.deForm`), which does not exist at the pure language-tower level. So this
slot is currently empty and will be filled once the local colimit and its term model are in place.
It is named (not left implicit) so the closure and its countability certificate already route through
it. -/

/-! ### The successor family `Γ_{k+1}` -/

/-- The **successor family**: the subformula/component closure (`setClosure bfSubformulas`) of the
successor seed. Closing under `bfSubformulas` makes `Γ_{k+1}` closed under immediate subformulas and
countable-connective components — the structural-induction requirement of the truth lemma — while the
Skolem-witness and (reserved) deForm generators sit in the seed. -/

/-! ### The stage bundle and the tower -/

/-- A single **stage** of the local Skolem tower: a language, a family of its formulas, and
countability certificates for the family and the language's symbol types. Bundling these keeps the
mutual language/family recursion a plain `ℕ`-indexed sequence rather than a dependent recursion. -/

(`Lang.sum (localSkolem Lang (skolemNeed Gamma))` — `skolemNeed` so the EM `all`-case witness
symbol for `¬ψ` of each `∀ψ ∈ Gamma` exists) and replace the family by its successor closure.
Every countability certificate is carried forward: the family via `localGammaNext_countable`, the
language via `sum_sigma_functions_countable` / `sum_sigma_relations_countable` together with
`localSkolem`'s own countability (fed by `skolemNeed_countable`). -/

# López–Escobar, hard direction (issue #10, Unit 5b)

The endpoint: every invariant Borel class of countable `L`-structures is the model class of a
single `L_ω₁ω`-sentence.

The assembly is Marker's, with every ingredient already proved:

1. `B` and `Bᶜ` are analytic, so Unit 0 (`exists_tree_of_analyticSet`) presents each by a
   cylinder tree — `T₀` for `B`, `T₁` for `Bᶜ`;
2. Unit 4 (`pcSentences_entails_not`) says the two PC sentences have no common model;
3. Craig separation (`craig_pcSeparation_relational`, issue #8) separates them by a sentence
   `θ₀` of their shared vocabulary;
4. Unit 5a (`sharedToBase`, `realize_sharedToBase`) decodes `θ₀` into an `L`-sentence and
   transports its truth to base codes;
5. both inclusions then use only the **invariance-free** forward presentation
   `subset_pcClass` (Unit 3a) — one side for `B`, the other for `Bᶜ`.

So `IsomorphismInvariant` is consumed exactly where Unit 3b/Unit 4 already consumed it,
inside `pcSentences_entails_not`; this unit adds no further use of it.

countable `L`-structures is the model class of a single `L_ω₁ω`-sentence. -/

  (title := /-- López-Escobar, hard direction -/)
  (statement := /-- Over a countable relational vocabulary, every isomorphism-invariant Borel
    class $B$ of coded countable structures is the model class of a single
    $\Lomegaone$-sentence. -/)
  (proof := /-- Marker's route (Theorem~4.3.7 of the 2016 book).  $B$ and its complement are Borel, hence
    analytic, so each is the branch projection of a cylinder tree along the query code.  Each
    tree is coded by a sentence $\Theta$ over the base language expanded by two disjoint
    tagged copies of a functional witness vocabulary (a constant, the successor, the code and
    branch functions, and a tree relation at every level), relationalized through the graph
    translation; the base reducts of $\Theta$'s models are exactly $B$, the converse inclusion
    being where isomorphism invariance is consumed.  The two presentations have no common
    model: gluing two tagged expansions of a common base model and passing to a countable
    fragment-elementary substructure would place one code in both $B$ and its complement.
    Craig separation therefore yields a sentence of the shared vocabulary separating them,
    and that vocabulary consists only of graph images of base relation symbols, so the
    separator decodes to an $\Lomegaone$-sentence over the base language.  Both inclusions
    then follow from the invariance-free forward presentation. -/)

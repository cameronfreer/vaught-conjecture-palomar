# Tail-restricted `L_{ω₁ω}` indiscernibility (neutral definition)

The bare definition of tail-restricted indiscernibility, factored out so both the EM stretching
pipeline (`Methods/EM/TailAdapter.lean`, which keeps every EM-dependent downstream lemma) and the
deliberately EM-free local `EMContext` re-base (`Methods/LocalEMContext.lean`) can refer to it
without either importing the other.

The definition depends only on `BoundedFormulaω.Realize`, `StrictMono`, and `ℕ`/`Fin` — nothing
from the EM/Admissible stack — so this file sits low in the import graph. It is on the default
surface (imported by `TailAdapter.lean` → `Admissible.lean`); being neutral and tiny, that is
harmless, unlike routing the def through the WIP-excluded `LocalEMSupport.lean`.

/-- **Tail-restricted indiscernibility**: for every formula of the family there is a cutoff
beyond which all strictly monotone tuples of the sequence agree. Weaker than
`IsLomega1omegaIndiscernibleOn` (which is the cutoff-`0` case), and the form actually
produced by Erdős–Rado extraction arguments. -/

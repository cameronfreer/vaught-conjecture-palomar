# Morley counting, with a witness in the second alternative

`morley_counting` says the number of isomorphism classes of countable models is `≤ ℵ₁` or exactly
`2^{ℵ₀}`.  Its second alternative is a bare cardinal equation: it asserts that continuum-many
classes exist without exhibiting them, and it cannot do better, because its
`SilverBurgessDichotomy` hypothesis carries only cardinal information.

Here the proved Silver route is used directly instead, through `silver_core_polish`, and the
second alternative becomes a **perfect set** of pairwise non-isomorphic models.  That is strictly
more information: continuum-many classes follows from a perfect antichain
(`HasPerfectSetOfPairwiseNonisomorphicNatModels.continuum_le`), so the cardinal form is recovered
as `morley_counting_or_perfect_cardinal` below, while the converse fails — a cardinal equation
gives no set.

## Two tiers, one pipeline

Countable models come in tiers: carrier `ℕ`, and carrier `Fin n` for each `n`.  The finite tier is
not a formality.  An infinite language can have continuum-many `Fin n`-models and no `ℕ`-models at
all, so a statement offering only an `ℕ`-tier perfect set would be false; hence the third
alternative.

Both tiers run through `silver_countable_or_cantorAntichain`, which handles the fact that the
model class is a *Borel* subset of the structure space and so is not Polish as a subtype.  They
differ only in which relation Silver is applied to:

* at `ℕ`, Silver sees back-and-forth equivalence at a level `α < ω₁` — the relation the Scott
  stratification makes Borel — and the antichain is transferred to isomorphism, which refines it;
* at `Fin n`, isomorphism is itself Borel (a finite union of permutation graphs), so Silver is
  applied to it directly.

`morley_counting` itself is left untouched: it remains the statement parameterized by the
dichotomy, and nothing here is a replacement for it.

/-! ### The per-level Silver step -/

/-- **A thin sentence has countably many back-and-forth classes at every countable level.**  If
`φ` is thin on its coded models, then for every `η < ω₁` the coded models of `φ` fall into
countably many classes of `bfEquivSetoid φ η`.

This is the only place Silver's theorem enters the `ℕ`-tier counting chain.  At each level,
`silver_countable_or_cantorAntichain` (hence `silver_core_polish`) is applied to the Borel
relation `bfEquivSetoid φ η` (`bfEquivSetoid_measurableSet`) on the Borel set `ModelsOf φ`, a
relation that isomorphism refines; the alternative, a Cantor antichain for isomorphism, gives a
perfect set of pairwise non-isomorphic models and contradicts thinness.  Both
`morley_counting_coded_or_perfect` and `Sentenceω.bfScattered_of_isThinOnNatModels`
(`Conditional/BFScatteredSilver.lean`) quote this lemma rather than repeating the step.  The
`Fin n` tier is separate: it applies Silver to isomorphism itself
(`counting_fin_models_countable_or_perfect`).

The levels are those of `BFScattered` (`Descriptive/BFScattered.lean`): an `Ordinal.{0}` below
`Ordinal.omega 1`, with no lift and no offset, and `bfEquivSetoid φ η` is by definition the
restriction to `ModelsOf φ` of the level-`η` relation there (`bfEquivSetoid_eq_comap`,
`Descriptive/BFScatteredSentence.lean`).  The conclusion is the hypothesis of the converse,
`Sentenceω.isThinOnNatModels_of_bfScattered`. -/

/-- **Morley counting for `ℕ`-coded models, with a witness.**  Either at most `ℵ₁` isomorphism
classes, or a perfect set of pairwise non-isomorphic models.

The case split is on the conclusion itself rather than on a cardinal: if no perfect set exists,
then no level of the stratification can produce a Cantor antichain, so every level has a countable
quotient and the Scott-height bound applies. -/

Unlike the `ℕ` tier this needs no stratification: isomorphism of `Fin n`-structures is the orbit
relation of a finite group, hence Borel outright, so Silver applies to it directly and the
relation-refinement step is the identity. -/

/-! ### The tiered theorem -/

/-- **Morley's counting theorem, with a witness in the second alternative.**

Either at most `ℵ₁` isomorphism classes of countable models, or a perfect set of pairwise
non-isomorphic models at one of the two tiers.

The `ℕ`-tier and `Fin n`-tier alternatives are kept separate because they are genuinely different
statements about different spaces, and because neither implies the other: a sentence may have a
perfect set of finite models and no infinite models whatsoever. -/

    $\operatorname{Fin} n$-models for some $n$. -/)
  (proof := /-- Combine the two per-tier witnessed dichotomies.  If neither tier yields a perfect
    set, the $\mathbb{N}$ tier contributes at most $\aleph_1$ classes and the countably many

/-! ### The cardinal form as a corollary

Recovering `morley_counting`'s conclusion from the witnessed one, which is the sense in which the
perfect alternatives carry more information rather than merely restating it.  The upper bound
`≤ 2^{ℵ₀}` is not part of the witnessed statement and is supplied here: every tier's quotient is a
quotient of a `Bool`-valued function space on a countable index. -/

/-- Each tier has at most continuum-many isomorphism classes. -/

/-- **The cardinal alternative, as a corollary of the witnessed one.**

This is `morley_counting`'s conclusion, obtained without assuming the Silver–Burgess dichotomy:
either alternative's perfect set forces continuum-many classes, and the ambient space supplies the
matching upper bound. -/

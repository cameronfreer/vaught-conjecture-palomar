# Counting Models

This file states model-counting results for Lω₁ω, connecting Scott rank bounds
to the structure of the isomorphism relation.

## Main Results

- `bounded_scottHeight_iso_eq_BFEquiv`: When all models of a sentence have Scott height
  bounded by α, isomorphism equals BF-equivalence at level α.
- `morley_counting_dichotomy`: Placeholder for the full Morley counting theorem.
  The conditional bounded-height version is in `Descriptive/CountingDichotomy.lean`
  as `counting_coded_models_dichotomy`.

/-- When a structure has `StabilizesCompletely M α` (with α < ω₁) and BFEquiv α holds,
the structures are isomorphic. Unconditional (no `CountableRefinementHypothesis` needed).

This decouples the isomorphism conclusion from scottRank entirely, taking
`StabilizesCompletely` as a direct hypothesis. -/

Conditional on `CountableRefinementHypothesis`.

This uses `scottHeight` (which has a clean conditional relationship to
`StabilizesCompletely`) rather than `scottRank`. -/

# The abstract PC-class membership predicate (issue #10, Unit 4)

`PCMem g Θ M` — a structure `M` for the base language `L` is in the projective class of an
`L'`-sentence `Θ` along `g : L →ᴸ L'` iff **`M` itself** (same carrier) expands to an
`L'`-structure modelling `Θ`.  This is Marker's `PC_{ω₁ω}` notion (Corollary 4.22): membership
is existence of a *same-carrier* expansion, enforced here by `LHom.IsExpansionOn`.

Deliberately language-generic and free of any nonemptiness assumption; the López–Escobar
specialization (`baseGraphEmb`, code compatibility) lives in `Methods/LopezEscobar/PCMem.lean`.

# Counting Theorem for All Countable Models

This file provides the user-facing counting theorem for all countable models
of an Lω₁ω sentence with bounded Scott height. It combines the ℕ-coded
result (via BF-equivalence Borelness) with finite-carrier results (via
permutation orbits) from `FiniteCarrier.lean`.

The type `AllCodedIsoClasses φ` faithfully represents all isomorphism classes
of countable models of φ, as established by the bridge theorems:
- `codeModel`: maps any countable model to a coded iso class
- `codeModel_eq_of_iso`: L-isomorphic models yield the same class
- `iso_of_codeModel_eq`: same class implies L-isomorphic
- `codeModel_surjective`: every class is realized

## Main Result

- `counting_countable_models_bounded_scottHeight`: The number of isomorphism
  classes of countable models (with bounded Scott height) is ≤ ℵ₀ or = 2^ℵ₀.

The stronger unconditional-height version (≤ ℵ₁ or 2^ℵ₀) is
`FirstOrder.Language.morley_counting` in `ModelTheory/MorleyCounting.lean`.

/-- Bounded-Scott-height counting theorem for all countable models.
The total number of isomorphism classes of countable models of φ
(with bounded Scott height) is either ≤ ℵ₀ or exactly 2^ℵ₀.

This combines ℕ-coded models (BF-equivalence Borelness, `counting_coded_models_dichotomy`)
with finite-carrier models (permutation orbits, `counting_fin_models_dichotomy`).
`AllCodedIsoClasses φ` faithfully represents all iso classes of countable models
(by `codeModel`, `codeModel_eq_of_iso`, `iso_of_codeModel_eq`, `codeModel_surjective`). -/
